                <small>Our Galaxy</small>
                <p>The Milky Way Galaxy takes its name from the Milky Way, the irregular luminous band of stars and gas
                    clouds that stretches across the sky as seen from Earth.The first reliable measurement of the size
                    of
                    the Milky Way Galaxy was made in 1917 by American astronomer Harlow Shapley. Assuming that the
                    globular
                    clusters outlined the Galaxy, he determined that it has a diameter of about 100,000 light-years. His
                    values have held up remarkably well over the years.The solar system is about 30,000 light-years from
                    the
                    centre of the Milky Way Galaxy. The Galaxy itself is thought to be about 100,000 light-years in
                    diameter.

                <p>Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity â€“ the planets
                    Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto;
                    dozens
                    of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have
                    discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the Milky Way.</p>
